How to figure out what tweets are actually relevant
	Here’s the current plan:
		Round 1: Run first round of sweeping
			Result: a bunch of tweets from all random users
		Round 2: Go through each user of each tweet from round 1 and grab as many tweets from their timeline as possible
			How I want to do this in code:
				array[] user_ids;
				for(i to user_ids.length){
					new array user_id_tweets;
					for(i to arbitrary large number of tweets I want){
						user_id_tweets[i] = query result;
					}
				}
		Round 3: Run each user’s tweets through m-turk workers
			Have each work rate whether a diagnosis happened in the set of the user’s tweets
			PROBLEM: This could get SUPER expensive if we run ALL tweets from round 1, especially since most of those tweets aren’t actually what we’re looking for
				Best plan of action to fix this? 
					Maybe have our research assistants manually filter out tweets?
					Has to be some better way through computer science
